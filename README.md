Module 3 Challenge Assignment
# Customer Banking System

This is a class assignment to create a customer banking system that allows users to calculate and track interest earned on savings and CD accounts. By running this application, users will be able to enter their savings and CD account information, see the interest earned, and view the updated balances after a specified number of months.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

## Description

The class was given starter code that establishes the Account class and other functions.  Our assignment was to adapt this starter code into a complete program that allows users will be able to enter their savings and CD account information, see the interest earned, and view the updated balances after a specified number of months.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- Python 3.10

### Installing

- Clone this repo to your environment

### Executing program

- Run program '**customer_banking.py**' from your cloned repo folder using terminal
- Follow the prompts to provide account balance, interest rate, and interest period.

1. Enter Savings Account Starting Balance

**Example entering 1000 dollars:**
<pre>Please enter the savings account balance: 1000
</pre>

2. Enter Savings Account Interest Rate

**Example entering 5% interest rate:**

<pre>Please enter the savings account interest rate: 5
</pre>

3. Enter Savings Account Interest Period

**Example entering 12 months**

<pre>Please enter the savings account interest period (months): 12
</pre>

4. Next Savings Account details are displayed based on user input provided.

**Example Savings Account output based on above entries:**

<pre>Savings Account Balance is: $1,050.00

Savings Account Interest Earned over 12 months is: $50.00
</pre>

5. Enter CD Account Starting Balance

**Example entering 1000 dollars:**
<pre>Please enter the CD account balance: 1000
</pre>

6. Enter CD Account Interest Rate

**Example entering 5% interest rate:**

<pre>Please enter the CD account interest rate: 5
</pre>

7. Enter CD Account Interest Period

**Example entering 12 months**

<pre>Please enter the CD account interest period (months): 12
</pre>

8. Next CD Account details are displayed based on user input provided.

**Example CD Account output based on above entries:**

<pre>CD Account Balance is: $1,050.00

CD Account Interest Earned over 12 months is: $50.00
</pre>

## Help

- Balance and Interest Rate are float data type
- Interest Period (months) is an integer data type
- There is no error checking of user inputs, so invalid entries will cause the program to crash
- Program runs through Savings Account followed by CD Account then terminates
